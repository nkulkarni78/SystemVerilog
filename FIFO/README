This repository contains synchronous FIFO design and complete test bench environment
developed in three stages. Design remains the same while the testbench approach kept
changing. First stage is with simple design and testbench with vcd files. Second one
is to add a selfchecking testbench and run dut. Third stage consists of class based
approach for complete system verilog test bench environment. The files are described
as below:


design.sv
Verilog Design file for Synchronous FIFO

## Type-1 consists of simple self checking testbench and top

selfchecking_tb.sv
selfchecking program block based testbench for DUT

top.sv
top file for DUT and program based testbench


## Type-2 SVTB environment with Transaction object and simple OOP concepts


## Type-3 Complete SVTB environment with Mod-ports and Clocking Blocks
